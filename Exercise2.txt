==================
Startup Exercise 2
==================

Initial Setup
=============

	* Make sure the setup steps of Exercise 1 are completed successfully
	* Install MSYS2 cpp compiler for windows
		* Download executable from: https://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/msys2-x86_64-20201109.exe
		* Follow C++ compiler installation (MinGw) as outlined in https://www.msys2.org/
	* Make sure the path to the gcc and g++ folder is added to the PATH variable
	
Code generation
===============

	* Create a folder named Cpp inside the solution from Exercise 1
	* Create a new C# class named "Generator" inside the newly created folder
	* Add a static method named GenerateCppFile
		* The method would generate a valid cpp file
		* The method would return the path to the created file as a string
	* Generate a valid cpp application that prints "Hello World!"
	
Code Compilation
================
	* Create C# class to represent a cpp compiler
	* The class has one method named CompileCppFile
		* The method takes the path of the cpp file as an argument
		* The method would compile the cpp file and produce a program with the same name of the file
		* The method returns the path to executable file
		
Program Execution
=================
	* Create a C# class named "ProgramRunner"
	* Add a static method called "RunProgram"
		* The method takes the path to the program as an input
		* The method executes the program and reads what the program writes to the standard output
		* The method returns what the program has written
	
Client Output
=============
	* Use the previous classes to generate the ServerMessage for the Run action in HelloWorldCppController
		* The message would be the outcome of running the generated and compiled program from sections "Code Generation" and "Code Compilation"
